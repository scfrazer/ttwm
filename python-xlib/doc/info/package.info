****************

The Python X Library is distributed as a Python package, named `Xlib'.
It contains a number of modules providing the main library interface:

`display'
     Contains the `Display' class, providing the X connection and access
     to all other X objects and operations.

`error'
     Contains all `Xlib' exception classes.

`threaded'
     Imported to set up the library to be thread-safe.

`rdb'
     Contains `ResourceDB', an X resource database class, and related
     code.

`X'
     Contains symbolic names for all basic X protocol constants.

`Xutil'
     Contains additional constants for mainly the ICCCM standard.

`XK'
     Contains symbolic names for all X keysyms.

`Xatom'
     Contains symbolic names for all standard X atoms.

`Xcursorfont'
     Contains symbolic names for all standard X fonts.


   There is also a number of subpackages, but they will mainly be of
interest to developers of the Xlib itself:

`protocol'
     The low-level protocol implementation.  Contains definitions of
     all X request, responses, events and errors, in addition to the
     core network code.  The high-level object oriented interface
     provided by `Xlib.display' is merely a wrapper around this package.

`support'
     Miscellaneous supporting code for handling threads and operating
     system-specific features.

`xobject'
     Contains classes for all X objects, which are returned by various
     display operations.

`ext'
     Contains various X protocol extensions.  Extensions supported by
     the server are loaded automatically at the display connection.
