2 Connect to a Display
**********************

To be able to perform any X operations, you must first establish a
connection to the display.  This is done by instantiating a
`display.Display' object:

 -- Class: Display ( [ displayname ] )
     Create a connection to the display called DISPLAYNAME.  If
     DISPLAYNAME is None or not provided, connect to the default
     display.

     If the connection fails for some reason, one of the errors from the
     following error class tree is raised:

          Exception
           \_error.DisplayError
              \_error.DisplayNameError
              \_error.DisplayConnectionError

     `error.DisplayNameError' is raised if DISPLAYNAME, or the default
     display name, is malformed.  `error.DisplayConnectionError' is
     raised if the connection to the X server fails.  This might be
     caused by the network connection to the display failing, or if the
     client isn't authorized to connect to the display.


   The syntax of a display name and how the library finds the default
display name depends on the operating system where the client runs.

2.1 Unix Display Names
======================

A display name on Unix has the following syntax:

     [hostname]:displayno[.screenno]

   If HOSTNAME is omitted this refers to a display on the same machine
as the client is running on.  A Unix socket is used to connect to the
display identified by `displayno', which must be an integer from 0 and
upwards.

   If HOSTNAME is specified, it gives the network name or IP-number of
the machine to contact.  A TCP socket is used, connecting to port
6000+DISPLAYNO on HOSTNAME.

   If the display contains more than one screen, SCREENNO can be
specified to make another screen than 0 the default screen.  If the
number is larger than the available maximum screen number, it will be
set to the maximum.

   A few examples:

     :0           Display 0 on this host, connects to the Unix socket
                  /tmp/.X11-unix/X0
     :0.1         Same as above, but specifying a different default screen

     myhost:0     Display 0 on myhost, connects to TCP port 6000
     myhost:10    Display 10 on myhost, connects to TCP port 6010

     localhost:0  Display 0 on localhost, i.e. the same host as the client
                  runs on.  Uses a TCP socket, while :0 uses a Unix socket

   The default display name is stored in the environmental variable
`DISPLAY'.  If that isn't set, `error.DisplayNameError' is raised.

2.2 OpenVMS Display Names
=========================

Currently the X Python Library only supports TCP connections on OpenVMS.
Display names are identical to Unix display names, but if the hostname
is omitted, `localhost' is used.  The default display name is
hard-coded to `localhost:0.0'.

   In the future, the native DECWindows system should be used.  This
means using LOCAL or DECNET transports if set, and using the logical
name `DECW$DISPLAY' as the default display.
